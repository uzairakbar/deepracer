## Setup and Install Dependencies
This project requires the following to work.
- Docker or Apptainer.
- Conda (or Python 3.10 or higher).
- Linux or Windows machine with an **Intel CPU**.

Please see the detailed setup instructions in [`SETUP.md`](https://github.gatech.edu/rldm/P4_deepracer/blob/main/SETUP.md).

## Usage

Launch the DeepRacer simulation.
```bash
source scripts/start_deepracer.sh \
    [-C=MAX_CPU; default="3"] \
    [-M=MAX_MEMORY; default="6g"]

# example:
# source scripts/start_deepracer.sh -C "3" -M "6g"
```

Interact with the environment via `gymnasium`.
```python
import gymnasium as gym
import deepracer_gym

env = gym.make('deepracer-v0')

observation, info = env.reset()

observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(
    env.action_space.sample()
)
```
